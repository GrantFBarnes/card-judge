                To start playing, create/join a lobby of at least three players (including yourself).
                The player who created the lobby will start as the judge.

                The prompt card will be displayed in the middle of the game board for all
                players to read.
            </p>
            <p>
                All players (except the judge) answer the question or fill in the blanks
                of the prompt card by selecting the amount of required response cards from
                their hand. Players can withdraw their play as long not all other
                players have played.
            </p>
            <p>
                The judge has the option to skip the current prompt card.
                Any response cards already played will be returned to the players hand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once all players have played the required amount of cards, the
                answers will be put in alphabetical order to ensure randomness.
                The judge will be able to reveal each response one at a time.
                The judge can rule-out any responses they do not like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once all cards are revealed the judge can select the winner.
                The judge should choose the response that they believe
                to be the best played response for the given prompt card.
                A random option is provided if the judge cannot decide between
                the remaining non-ruled-out responses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The judge choosing a winner concludes that round.
                The player who won is awarded a point on the scoreboard.
                The judge rotates based on the order players joined the lobby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gameplay can continue until there are no more cards to draw from the draw
                pile or when players agree to finish. The player with the most points is
                the winner.

            <p>
                A lobby will have a set credit limit for each player.
                Credits can be used to purchase Specials at varying costs.
                Specials vary from gambling credits to potentially earn more,
                to playing Special Cards which are an alternative way to play a turn.
                Each Special has a help icon next to it to display what it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Credits can be earned/lost through win/lose streaks.
                The streak amount can be set per lobby.
                This is to help balance and allow those who may be winning more
                to lose credits, and allow those losing more to gain credits and catch up.
