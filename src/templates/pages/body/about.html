    <p>
      To start playing, create/join a lobby of at least three players (including
      yourself). The player who created the lobby will start as the judge.

    <p>
      The judge card will be displayed in the middle of the game board for all
      players to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      All players (except the judge) answer the question or fill in the blanks
      of the judge card by selecting the amount of required player cards from
      their hand. Players can withdrawal their play as long not all other
      players have played.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge has the option to skip the current judge card as long as no
      player has played a card yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once all players have played the required amount of cards, the answers
      will be visible to all in alphabetical order (to ensure randomness). The
      judge will be able to select the card of their choosing that they believe
      to be the best played for the given judge card.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge choosing a winner concludes that round. The player who won
      becomes the new judge and is awarded a point on the scoreboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gameplay can continue until there are no more cards to draw from the draw
      pile or when players agree to finish. The player with the most points is
      the winner.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="summary-level-2">Credits/Special Cards</summary>
    <p>
      A lobby will have a set credit limit for each player. Credits can be used
      to purchase Special Cards. Special Cards are an alternative way to play a
      turn.
